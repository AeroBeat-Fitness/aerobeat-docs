# Refund & Cancellation Policy

**Last Updated:** [Date]

AeroBeat operates on a "Support, Don't Buy" model. Our "Supporter" tags are voluntary contributions to help fund server costs and open-source development. Because of this, our refund policy differs from traditional subscription services.

## 1. Nature of Purchase

*   **Donation-Based:** Payments made for Supporter status are classified as **voluntary donations** with incidental benefits.
*   **Non-Recurring:** All purchases are for a fixed period (e.g., 1 Month, 1 Year). **We do not store your card for auto-renewal.** You will never be charged automatically.

## 2. General Refund Policy

**All sales are final.**

Because Supporter status provides immediate access to server-side benefits (Cloud Storage, API usage) and is treated as a donation to the project, we generally do not offer refunds for "change of mind" or "unused time".

## 3. Exceptional Circumstances

We understand that errors happen. We will consider refund requests under the following specific circumstances:

### A. Technical Errors

If a technical glitch caused a **duplicate charge** or if you were charged for a tier you did not select, we will issue a full refund for the erroneous transaction immediately.

### B. Fraudulent Activity

If your card was used without your permission, please contact your bank to initiate a dispute, or contact us immediately to reverse the charge before it settles.

### C. Long-Term Pro-Ration (Case-by-Case)

For purchases of **1 Year or longer**, if you are unable to use the service due to permanent hardware failure or medical reasons, you may request a pro-rated refund for the unused months.

*   *Calculation:* `Refund = (Total Paid) - (Months Used * Monthly Rate)`.
*   *Note:* The "Months Used" are calculated at the standard $4.00/mo rate, not the discounted yearly rate.

## 4. Account Terminations

If your account is suspended or banned due to a violation of our **Code of Conduct** or **Terms of Service** (e.g., cheating, hate speech, uploading malicious content), you forfeit all remaining Supporter time. **No refunds will be issued for banned accounts.**
