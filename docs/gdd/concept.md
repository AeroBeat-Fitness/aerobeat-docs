# AeroBeat: Concept Overview

**AeroBeat** is an open-source, modular rhythm game platform designed to democratize fitness gaming.

Unlike traditional rhythm games that are locked to specific ecosystems (VR headsets, pc, mobile, or consoles), AeroBeat is **Gameplay Agnostic**, **Hardware Agnostic**, and **Input Agnostic**. Each piece of the engine is expandable to support a variety of rhythm workout gameplay mechanics across a variety of devices.

Our first featured rhythm workout Gameplay style is **Boxing** for laptop and desktop PC's. By utilizing Computer Vision (CV) to turn standard webcams into high-fidelity motion controllers, we allow anyone with a laptop or desktop to access a premium workout experience previously reserved for VR owners.

## 🎯 The High Concept

> **"The YouTube of Workout Games."**

AeroBeat is not just a game; it is a **Platform** consisting of three decoupled layers:
1.  **The Inputs:** How you move (Webcam, VR, Joycons, Keyboard, Mouse, Controller). Extensible with open and closed hardware API's.
2.  **The Engine:** The core rhythm logic, audio synchronization, and scoring.
3.  **The Content:** Community-created playlists, songs, assets, environments, and even entirely new gameplay mechanics (ex: **Flow**, **Step**, and **Dance**).

### Key Pillars
* **Accessibility First:** Hardware should not be a gatekeeper. If you have any supported device and input type, you can play any gameplay mode.
* **Fitness First:** Gameplay is designed for healthy habits, pushing for full movements that are safe to perform repeatedly.
* **Open Ecosystem:** Built on Godot and open standards to encourage community modding and proprietary hardware integrations.
