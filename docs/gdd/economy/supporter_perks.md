# Supporter Perks & Benefits

AeroBeat operates on a "Support, Don't Buy" model. The core game is free, and becoming a Supporter is a voluntary contribution to help fund servers and development. In return, Supporters receive a suite of account-level perks focused on convenience, customization, and community status.

## 3. Philosophy on Restrictions

We strictly adhere to a **Free-to-Win** policy.

*   **No Gameplay Locking:** We never lock Songs, Modes, or Maps behind the Supporter tag.
*   **No Pay-to-Win:** Supporters do not get gameplay advantages (e.g., higher scores or easier hit windows).
